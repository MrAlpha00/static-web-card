Act as a senior full-stack web developer. You are working in a pure static HTML/CSS/JavaScript Replit project (no backend, no databases, no Replit-specific services).

I want you to build a full website for a local business called Elite Technology with the following requirements.

TECH & HOSTING CONSTRAINTS (IMPORTANT)

Use ONLY:

HTML

CSS (Tailwind or custom CSS allowed)

Vanilla JavaScript (no build tools required)

Do NOT set up:

Node.js, Express, Flask, Django or any backend server

Replit DB, Replit Auth, or any Replit-specific backend services

The final code must be deployable as a simple static site on:

GitHub Pages

Netlify

Keep everything as static files.

For Phase 2 (admin features), use Firebase on the frontend only:

Firebase Authentication

Cloud Firestore

Firebase Storage

No backend server is allowed.

Dark background (black or dark grey)
